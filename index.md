I am a [PhD](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/phd) student in the [Mobile Systems](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk) group at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk) of the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). With my supervisor, [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/), I am investigating the end-to-end automation of the Machine Learning pipeline for sparse and unlabelled data. My interests span the areas of uncertainty estimation, Evidential Deep Learning, AutoML and Active Learning, and I am always open to exploring new promising topics. My research is supported by the [EPSRC CDT in Sensor Technologies for a Healthy and Sustainable Future](https://cdt.sensors.cam.ac.uk) and by [Arm](https://www.arm.com).

Prior to starting my PhD studies, I completed an [MRes](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/mres) in Sensor Technologies and Applications and an [MPhil](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/mphil) in Advanced Computer Science, both from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). I also hold a [BSc](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/computer-science-bsc) in Computer Science from [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).
